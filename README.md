# Fractal Sparse-Origin Hypothesis (FSOH)

**Fractal Sparse-Origin Hypothesis (FSOH)** proposes that the emergence and distribution of life in the universe follow a **fractal, sparse, and strongly constrained structure**, rather than a uniform or weakly random process.  

This repository provides the conceptual framework, mathematical skeleton, and (in future versions) computational tools for exploring the FSOH model.

## 1. Overview

FSOH addresses two core questions:

1. **Why is life extremely rare, despite the vastness of the universe?**  
2. **Why do local environments that support life appear as “fractal oases” rather than uniformly distributed habitats?**

The hypothesis assumes that:

- Life is not only constrained by local chemistry and temperature,  
- But also by **multi-scale structural conditions** that follow a **fractal and sparse** pattern in space, time, and underlying physical fields.

FSOH is designed as a **structure-level model**:  
it does not depend on any specific biochemistry, but rather on abstract constraints on where life *can* appear.

## 2. Core Ideas

FSOH is built on the following conceptual pillars:

- **Fractal Structure**  
  The universe exhibits nested structures (from large-scale cosmic web down to planetary environments).  
  FSOH assumes that *life-eligible regions* follow a similar nested pattern.

- **Sparse Origin**  
  Even within life-friendly zones, the *actual* emergence of life is **highly suppressed** and occurs only in a small subset of possible sites.

- **Constraint Layers**  
  The model separates constraints into multiple layers (e.g. cosmic, galactic, planetary, micro-environmental), each acting as a “filter” that reduces the probability of life.

- **Effective Observational Bias**  
  Any observer (such as humans) will, by construction, find themselves in a rare, high-constraint-satisfied region, creating strong selection effects.

## 3. Axioms (Conceptual Form)

FSOH can be summarized by a small set of axioms.  
The exact mathematical formalizations are left to the accompanying paper, but the logical form is:

**Axiom 1 – Fractal Habitat Structure**  
The set of regions that can in principle host life can be represented as a **fractal subset** of the underlying physical space (or state space), with non-trivial dimension \( D_f \) and strong scale dependence.

**Axiom 2 – Multi-Layer Constraints**  
The probability that life can *emerge* in a given region is determined by the intersection of multiple constraint layers:
\[
\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{C}_{\text{cosmic}} \cap \mathcal{C}_{\text{galactic}} \cap \mathcal{C}_{\text{stellar}} \cap \mathcal{C}_{\text{planetary}} \cap \mathcal{C}_{\text{micro}}
\]

**Axiom 3 – Sparse Effective Origin**
